- 👋 Hi, I’m @BigPasta67
- 👀 I’m interested in Magic: The Gathering and music production. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code in C++ since I haven't had opportunities to do so in college. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating new projects that involve either MTG or some level of music production via MIDI controls.
