- 👋 Hi, I’m @BigPasta67
- 👀 I’m interested in creating scripts for Magic: The Gathering and music production purposes. I also want to complete more hardware programming projects for around the house or just for fun :). Perhaps I may work on creating another game project in Unity at some point as well!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code in C++ since I haven't had opportunities to do so in college. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating new projects that involve either MTG or some level of music production via MIDI controls.
- 📫 You can reach me by messaging me on GitHub. If you are interested in working on a project involving MTG or something else that's interesting, let me know!
